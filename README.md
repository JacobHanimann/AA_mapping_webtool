# AA_mapping_webtool

Align isoforms dynamically with the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and set the minimal exon length to discard falsely mapped positions. The current human library consists of ~24k protein coding genes covering ~190k protein sequences and +1.M mapped isoform ID's from Ensembl, Uniprot, Refseq and HGNC
